Prerequisites  Before you begin, make sure you have these installed:     Python (version 3.10 or higher) Download from python.org . Check with python --version in your terminal.     PreTeXt CLI  Install with pip install pretext      Git (for version control and deployment) Download from git-scm.com . Check with git --version .      Building Your Project  The project uses a custom build script that compiles PreTeXt and injects custom CSS styling:  .\/build.sh  This script:   Runs pretext build web to generate HTML  Copies custom CSS and assets to output\/web\/  Injects custom styling into all HTML files   To view your journal locally, the PreTeXt Server workflow is already running on port 5000. Just open the Webview pane in Replit, or navigate to http:\/\/localhost:5000 in your browser.   Important: Always use .\/build.sh instead of pretext build directly to ensure your custom styling is applied!   "

  "body": " Deploying to GitHub Pages  deployment  GitHub Pages   Make your math journal publicly accessible by deploying to GitHub Pages. Your site will be available at https:\/\/username.github.io\/repository-name\/     Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository    Go to github.com and sign in    Click the + button in the top right, then New repository    Name your repository (e.g., my-zettelkasten )    Choose Public (required for free GitHub Pages)    Do NOT initialize with README (we already have files)    Click Create repository      Step 2: Connect Your Project to GitHub  In your terminal (Shell in Replit), run these commands:  git init git add . git commit -m \"Initial commit: PreTeXt math journal\" git branch -M main git remote add origin https:\/\/github.com\/username\/repository-name.git git push -u origin main  Replace username and repository-name with your actual GitHub username and repository name.   Note: You will be prompted for your GitHub username and password. For the password, use a Personal Access Token (not your actual password).    Step 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages  Choose one of two deployment methods: automatic GitHub Actions or manual git subtree.   Method A: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended)  This method automatically deploys your site every time you push changes to GitHub.  First, create the workflow directory:  mkdir -p .github\/workflows  Create a file .github\/workflows\/deploy.yml with this content:  name: Deploy to GitHub Pages on: push: branches: [main] workflow_dispatch: permissions: contents: read pages: write id-token: write jobs: build-and-deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout code uses: actions\/checkout@v4 - name: Setup Python uses: actions\/setup-python@v4 with: python-version: '3.11' - name: Install PreTeXt CLI run: pip install pretext - name: Build with custom styling run: chmod +x build.sh && .\/build.sh - name: Upload to GitHub Pages uses: actions\/upload-pages-artifact@v3 with: path: 'output\/web' - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages id: deployment uses: actions\/deploy-pages@v4  Then configure GitHub Pages:   Go to repository Settings → Pages  Under Source , select GitHub Actions   Now commit and push your workflow file:  git add .github\/workflows\/deploy.yml git commit -m \"Add GitHub Actions deployment\" git push  Your site will automatically build and deploy! Check the Actions tab in GitHub to monitor progress.  Your site will be live at https:\/\/username.github.io\/repository-name\/     Method B: Manual Deployment (Alternative)  If you prefer manual control, you can build locally and deploy manually:  .\/build.sh git add output\/web git commit -m \"Build for deployment\" git subtree push --prefix output\/web origin gh-pages  Then configure GitHub Pages to use the gh-pages branch:   Go to Settings → Pages  Under Source , select Deploy from a branch  Select branch gh-pages and folder \/ (root)    Note: Method A (GitHub Actions) is recommended for automatic updates!     Step 4: Updating Your Live Site  After making changes to your math journal source files:  .\/build.sh git add . git commit -m \"Add new topology notes\" git push   Using GitHub Actions (Method A): Your site updates automatically! GitHub will run the build script and deploy within 1-2 minutes.   Using Manual Deployment (Method B): Run the git subtree command again:  git subtree push --prefix output\/web origin gh-pages   "
