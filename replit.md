# Zettelkasten-Diataxis Math Journal (PreTeXt Edition)

## Overview

This is a Zettelkasten-Diataxis hybrid mathematics journal built with PreTeXt. The project combines networked note-taking (Zettelkasten method) with PreTeXt's powerful mathematical typesetting and web publishing. Content is organized using the Diataxis framework (Prototypes, Tutorials, Explanations, Reference) and features MathJax for beautiful mathematical rendering, proper academic citations via BibTeX, and custom styling that preserves the original cyan-purple gradient design aesthetic.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Content: No AI-generated content except layout and styling. Sample prototype notes include AI warnings.

## System Architecture

### PreTeXt Structure
- **PreTeXt 2.30.2**: Professional mathematical authoring and publishing system
- **XML Source Format**: Content authored in PreTeXt XML with semantic markup for mathematical structures
- **Diataxis Organization**: Notes organized into chapters following the Diataxis framework (Prototypes, Tutorials, Explanations, Reference)
- **MathJax Rendering**: Beautiful mathematical typesetting with MathJax integration
- **Networked Notes**: Cross-references between mathematical concepts using PreTeXt's `<xref>` system
- **Academic Citations**: Proper bibliography management with `<cite>` elements and backmatter references
- **Custom Styling**: CSS injected via build script to preserve original design aesthetic

### Build System
- **PreTeXt CLI 2.30.2**: Command-line tool for building HTML and PDF outputs
- **Custom Build Script**: `build.sh` handles PreTeXt build and CSS injection
- **Asset Management**: Images and custom assets stored in `/assets/` directory
- **HTML Output**: Generated to `/output/web/` directory with responsive modern theme
- **Development Server**: PreTeXt built-in server on port 5000 for live preview

### Styling Architecture
- **Design System**: Custom color palette with cyan-to-purple gradient scheme
- **Typography System**: Aclonica font for all headings, sidebar, and UI elements; Merriweather serif for body paragraphs (optimal readability for mathematical content)
- **Tag Styling**: Pill-style tags with 50px border radius, Aclonica font, gradient backgrounds, and hover effects
- **Glassmorphic Design**: Custom CSS classes for glass effects with backdrop blur
- **Responsive Design**: Custom responsive utilities for mobile-first approach
- **Custom Animations**: Gradient text animations and interactive hover effects
- **Collapsible Groups**: Smooth expand/collapse transitions for note category organization

### Development Workflow
- **PreTeXt Development**: Custom `build.sh` script for building and CSS injection
- **Live Preview**: PreTeXt server on port 5000 with automatic rebuilds
- **Content Editing**: Direct XML editing in `/source/` directory

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **PreTeXt CLI 2.30.2**: Mathematical authoring and publishing system

### Asset Management
- **Custom Assets**: Logo, favicon, wisp background, orb decorations, ember and moon graphics
- **Static Assets**: Stored in `/assets/` directory and injected into PreTeXt build output
- **Font System**: Aclonica for headings/UI, Merriweather for body text, Fira Code for code blocks

## Deployment

The journal can be deployed to GitHub Pages for free public hosting:
- **GitHub Actions (Recommended)**: Automatic deployment on every push to main branch
- **Manual**: Using git subtree to push output/web to gh-pages branch
- **Build Command**: Always use `./build.sh` to preserve custom CSS and styling

See the tutorial section in the journal itself for complete deployment instructions.

- **Workflow Documentation**: Documented recommended practices for building, committing, and deploying changes

### Repository Cleanup (Nov 13, 2025)
- **Added .gitignore**: Comprehensive ignore rules for Python, PreTeXt output, caches, and temporary files
- **Removed Legacy Code**: Deleted deprecated React client folder (project now fully on PreTeXt)
- **Cleaned Temporary Files**: Removed development logs, attached assets, and empty directories
- **Updated Documentation**: Streamlined replit.md to reflect current PreTeXt-only architecture

### CSS Overrides for Footer and TOC (Nov 13, 2025)
- **Footer Centering Fix**: Added CSS to override PreTeXt's float rules on footer images and paragraphs, ensuring flexbox layout centers logo and copyright text side-by-side
- **TOC Styling Cleanup**: Removed all default PreTeXt list markers, text transforms, font variants, and letter spacing from table of contents
- **Custom TOC Spacing**: Added explicit padding and margins to TOC items for clean, modern appearance without bullets or uppercase forcing
- **TOC Active State Fix**: Overrode PreTeXt's default periwinkle background on active `.toc-title-box` elements with transparent backgrounds, allowing custom cyan-purple gradient to show through
- **TOC Rounded Corners**: Removed square container borders from nested active lists, ensuring all TOC items use consistent 8px border radius matching site design

### PreTeXt Conversion (Nov 13, 2025)
- **Complete Migration**: Converted entire project from React/Vite to PreTeXt XML format
- **Content Preservation**: All mathematical notes (topology, metric spaces, continuous functions, sequences) migrated to PreTeXt sections
- **Citation System**: Implemented proper `<cite>` elements linking to backmatter bibliography (luhmann1984, munkres2000, rudin1976, spivak2008, apostol1974)
- **Custom Styling**: Preserved original cyan-purple gradient design using CSS injection via `build.sh` script
- **Glassmorphic Effects**: Maintained dark theme with backdrop blur effects on masthead, sidebar, content areas, and footer
- **Typography Preservation**: Aclonica font for all headings (with gradient effects), Merriweather serif for body text, Fira Code for code blocks
- **Build Workflow**: Created custom `build.sh` script that builds PreTeXt HTML and injects custom CSS automatically
- **Development Server**: PreTeXt server running on port 5000 with live preview capability
- **Project Structure**: Clean XML organization with source files in `/source/`, assets in `/assets/`, output in `/output/web/`
- **Navigation Styling**: All buttons (top nav and footer) use glassmorphic gradient backgrounds with cyan-to-purple theme and smooth hover animations
- **Footer Branding**: Custom eigenscribe © 2025 footer with logo and gradient text, centered navigation buttons  
- **Selected Section Styling**: Active TOC sections have subtle cyan background (`rgba(20, 181, 255, 0.15)`) with cyan border
- **Page Footer**: Custom eigenscribe © 2025 branding with logo and copyright text side-by-side, centered together; replaces default PreTeXt/Runestone/MathJax attribution links
- **Theme Button Removed**: Light/dark theme switcher hidden via CSS (`#light-dark-button`) - dark glassmorphic theme only
